# Minecraft Wither - Fully Articulated

**I am moving this design off of Thingiverse in protest of their attempt to patent designs originally conceived by the 3D printing community. For more information, please see the following article: http://www.openbeamusa.com/blog/2014/5/22/stay-classy-makerbot**  

**#makerbot, #takerbot**  

My son and his friend requested a [Minecraft Wither](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wither), with the ability to move all three heads. I wanted it a nice size - not too big, not too small. However with printed pins, it limits the minimum size of a model as I've found small pins tend to wear over the long term. In the end, I decided to try using [LEGO Technic pins](http://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-technic-pin-with-lengthwise-friction-ridges-and-center-slots-2780), which my son has a LOT of sitting in his LEGO assembly cabinet.  If you need a bunch, you can find them on Amazon or Ebay for $10 for ~300 pins.  

All in all, this assembly method turned out VERY well.  I've printed two of these Withers on my i3 and they fit together nicely. The pins snap in solidly and they hold the parts just about as well as in normal LEGO bricks.  

I took inspiration for this project from "arthurtilly" and his Tiny Wither: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:320990

# Instructions

I print all of my parts with a 0.4mm nozzle, three perimeters, 0.25mm layer height, 20% infill, at 195C / 65C (extruder / hbp).  

I print the face parts with the faces pointing up and the body laying on its back, in combination with support using Cura.  You may need to reorient the parts before printing so they are facing in the appropriate direction...  

NOTE: All parts were modeled in Inventor and STLs were exported for printing.
